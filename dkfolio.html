      <p>Originally from Canada, Danielle currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband, Bryce, and
        their two furry companions, Charlie and Millie! Their shared passions include exploring the world together
        through activities such as frisbee beach outing, hiking, and road tripping. As big nerds, they enjoy kicking
        back to play The Legend of Zelda or watch Harry Potter. They are also creators at heart and find joy in
        expressing our originality through a variety of mediums; including woodworking, epoxy resin projects, abstract
        painting, instruments, and more!</p>

      <p>Danielle’s knowledge of human anatomy, physiology, and optics from her educational background and job as an
        ophthalmic technician enhances her grasp of the technicalities of photography, resulting in visually pleasing
        and scientifically precise images. Bryce' s proficiency in website design and development is the critical
        element that unites our work with yours.</p>

      <p>Our objective is to immerse viewers into breathtaking moments through our lens, whether it's a print from our
        store, a custom website or a personalized photo crafted to suit your needs.</p>
